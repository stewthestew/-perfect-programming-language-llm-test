I have asked popular llm's to make the perfect language for me.

1. ChatGPT o4-mini
2. Deepseek with "deepthink-r1"
3. gemini 2.5 pro
4. Claude 3.7 sonnet
5. grok 3 with "Think"

The prompt I used for the llms was:

```
Make me the "perfect language possible" you could make, I need you to use golang to make the so called language, and I want the language to be usable for daily usage, it does not need to be a monolith like python or as simple as lua, whatever fits you. Make it interpreted

```

except chatgpt since it wasn't cooperative, and was trying to be clever and "design" the language with me I used the prompt:

```
Make me the "perfect language possible" you could make, I need you to use golang to make the so called language, and I want the language to be usable for daily usage, it does not need to be a monolith like python or as simple as lua, whatever fits you. Make it interpreted. Don't talk about proposals, JUST CODE IT IN ONE FILE. DONT DO ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN MAKING THE LANGUAGE

```

and google gemini split them into multiple files, which I didn't like, so I responded with `Please make it all in one file`

The llm's were asked to name their language, and this is what they came up with:

grok: DailyScript

gemini: Aura

chatgpt: GoScript

claude: Flow

deepseek: Glimmer

not all of the languages actually worked, the one that impressed me the most was google with its aura language, it is just a REPL from what I am seeing, but it is pretty impressive,
grok with dailyscript had the best syntax language syntax wise, but it just made me a lexer.
